# Final_Project
The project is about analysing the data for a bikeshare company that is located in Chicago.
The data is found on the company's website available for the public: https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html
The data is for the the year 2023, and it is about 5.6 million rows
A second set of data will be added using webscraping about the weather at the  time of the rides, to see the relation between these variables.
Visulaization with Tableau will be used to show the relation between variables.
